<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

- The group-chat-api was deployed on [Heroku](https://nodejs.org/) and can be accessed from [here](https://lawaldd-group-chat.herokuapp.com/)
- It was my first time implementing real-time communication, I used [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) for that. Building the app was an exciting experience for me. Especially for the fact that I had the liberty to do almost everything from backend to DevOps, the font end will be built with react.
